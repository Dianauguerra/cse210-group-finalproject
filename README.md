## Space Race
Space Race is a space-themed racing game where you race against your opponent in outer space. You race across the galaxy, dodging meteorits. Each successful trip through space earns an individual score.

## Rules
There are two players. Each one has a ship. The ships can move up to down or viceversa. To move, Player one uses "W" for UP and "S" for DOWN. Player two uses "I" for UP and "K" for DOWN. Whoever gets to the top succesfully by dodging the meteors, earns a point. The race lasts three minutes, good luck! To stop the game simply close the window.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Arcade Python 2.6.10 installed and running on your machine. You can install Arcade Python by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 space_race
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    ( project root folder )
+-- space_race          ( source code for game )
  +-- game              ( game specific classes )
    +-- casting         ( various actor classes )
    +-- directing       ( game class ) 
    +-- shared          ( various shared clases )
  +-- __main__.py       ( program entry point )
  +-- constants.py      ( game constants )
+-- README.md           ( general info )
