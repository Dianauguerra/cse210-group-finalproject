## Space Race
Space Race is a space-themed racing game where you race against your opponents in outer space. You race across the galaxy, dodging meteors and asteroids. Each successful trip through space earns an individual score.

## Rules
There are 2 players. Each one has a ship. The ships can move left to right or right to left. To move, Player 1 uses "a" for left and "d" for right. Player 2 uses "j" for left and "l" for right. Whoever gets to the top succesfully by dodging the meteors, earns a point. To stop the game simply close the window.
